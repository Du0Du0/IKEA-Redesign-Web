            <h2>Catalina Zarhi</h2>
            <p>Catalina is a ceramist and designer from Chile, whose work is inspired by the natural landscapes of
              Northern and
              Southern Chile. Many of her works explore irregularities and organic lines: elevating the imperfect
              and
              evoking the
              natural elements of nature through the medium of clay. Having studied ceramics in Italy, the United
              States and her
              native Chile, her work marries traditional techniques with contemporary forms to create delicate works
              of art in muted
              tones.<br><br><span>“My designs are soft consisting of earth colours, simple lines, and clean, organic
